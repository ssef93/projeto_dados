        <h2>Garlic Parmesan Chicken Wings
        </h2>
        <p>Keep these baked garlic parmesan chicken wings crispy by parboiling the wings in a flavorful liquid, which helps season the chicken and produce a surface texture in the oven that your guests will swear came straight out of a deep fryer. Serve with creamy Italian dressing for dipping.</p>
